## Overview

### Interactive Visual Analytics

The `SpaceX_Interactive_Visual_Analytics_Folium.ipynb` notebook contains interactive maps and visualizations to explore SpaceX launch sites and other related data.

### Machine Learning Prediction

The `SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.ipynb` notebook focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict outcomes related to SpaceX launches.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- `jupyter-labs-eda-Visualization.ipynb`: Visual EDA of SpaceX data.
- `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`: EDA using SQL queries.

### Data Collection

- `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb`: Collecting data from the SpaceX API.
- `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb`: Web scraping SpaceX data from various sources.

### Data Wrangling

The `labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb` notebook involves cleaning and preparing the SpaceX data for analysis.

### Dash Application

The `spacex_dash_app.py` script creates a web application using Dash to visualize and interact with SpaceX data.
